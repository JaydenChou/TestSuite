# Contributing Guidelines

## Requesting Features, Reporting Bugs

Issues are used to request features as well as report bugs.
When creating a new issue, please include as much information as possible.
A maintainer will then review the issue and assign it to a release milestone if applicable.

## Pull Requests

Please feel free to fork and send pull requests.
Requests should be sent to the master branch and a maintainer will review and merge your requests.
