# Sensit Technologies C# Test Suite & SDK
This is a software suite for automating instrumentation and sensor tests and calibration.

## Development Environment
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) or later - Community edition is free.
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 - If Visual Studio is already installed but the correct framework is not, run the Visual Studio Installer, navigate to *Individual Components* and select the appropriate framework.
* [Keysight IO Libraries Suite](https://www.keysight.com/en/pd-1985909/io-libraries-suite) - VISA drivers necessary to communicate with Keysight/Agilent instruments.  You could also use the National Instruments VISA drivers.

## Code Standards
Attention was given to making this software suite as easy to read and modify as
possible, and one part of that is making sure to follow community best practices
as much as possible.  The following links describe best practices that should be
considered by contributors to this project:
